#### This project aims to build an autonomous network using a wireless access point based on a Raspberry Pi 5 running Kali Linux, along with a USB LTE Modem and an Alfa AWUS036ACH Wi-Fi adapter. The network includes:

1. A Captive Portal for user authentication integrated with a database, secured with SSL/TLS.
2. User network connection management, allowing traffic prioritization and forced disconnections.
3. Security anomaly detection for MITM and DDoS attacks, with automated network management responses.
4. The setup involves configuring hostapd for the access point, setting up a web server for the captive portal, managing user traffic with firewall rules and QoS, and using intrusion detection systems for security.
